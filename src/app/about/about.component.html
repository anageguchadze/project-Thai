        <p>Thai-Thai This combination of family emotions and years of experience 
            in gastronomy has created a tastefully decorated place where the 
            talent of excellent Thai chefs guarantees the authenticity and the 
            highest quality of oriental dishes in unique interiors in the heart 
            of Warsaw.

            Seduced by the colors and subtle, often surprising combinations of flavors offered by Asian cuisine, we wanted to create a vibrant culinary space with an oriental character. The resulting restaurant allows you to enter the world of aromatic spices, seafood, juicy meats and original additives
        </p>
        <p>The truly oriental taste of the dishes served in our restaurant is due to the combination of the craftsmanship of the chefs, as well as the attention to the high quality of the dishes, which are made on the basis of fresh products and original spices and additives found in Thai cuisine.</p>
